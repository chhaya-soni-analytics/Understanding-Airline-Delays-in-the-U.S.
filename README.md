# ✈️ Understanding Airline Delays in the U.S.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on U.S. airline delay data using Python.
The main objective is to understand the key factors responsible for flight delays and analyze patterns
across airlines, airports, and delay causes.

This project is created as part of my **Data Analyst learning journey** to strengthen
data analysis, visualization, and storytelliAng skills.
